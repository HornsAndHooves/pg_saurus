# Adds ability to configure in migration how index will be created.
# See more details how to create index concurrently in PostgreSQL at
# (see http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/sql-createindex.html#SQL-CREATEINDEX-CONCURRENTLY).
#
# There are several things you should be aware when use option to create index
# concurrently.
# Index can not be created concurrently inside transaction and such indexes
# creation will be postponed till migration transaction will be closed.
# In case of migration failure and transaction was rolled back indexes will not
# be created concurrently. But if indexes which should be created concurrently
# run with errors migration's transaction won't be rolled back. Error in that
# case will be raised and migration process will be stoped.
#
# Migrations can not ensure that all indexes that tend to be created
# concurrently were created even if the query for such index creation run
# without errors. Such indexes creation are deferred because of its nature.
# So, it's up to you to ensure that indexes was really created or remove
# partially created invalid indexes.
#
# :concurrent_index option conflicts with :exclude_index option in method
# `add_foreign_key`. So, if you put them together exception will be raised.
#
# @example
#
#   class AddIndexToNameForUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
#     def change
#       add_index :users, :name, :concurrently => true
#     end
#   end
#
#   # or with foreign key
#
#   class AddForeignKeyToRoleIdForUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
#     def change
#       add_foreign_key :users, :roles, :concurrent_index => true
#     end
#   end
